# React-native-web for PWA

I want to try all available UI libraries:

- [tamagui](https://tamagui.dev/)
  - see `tamagui` branch in this repo
- [paper](https://reactnativepaper.com/)
  - see `react-native-paper` branch in this repo
- [React Native UI Kitten](https://akveo.github.io/react-native-ui-kitten/docs/guides/running-on-the-web#existing-expo-applications)
  - see `react-native-ui-kitten` branch in this repo
- [RNUI](https://wix.github.io/react-native-ui-lib/)
  - see `react-native-ui-lib` branch in this repo
- [magnus](https://magnus-ui.com/)
  - depends on `react-native-reanimated` which causes issues, see `react-native-paper` branch
- [gluestack-ui](https://ui.gluestack.io/), successor for [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/)
  - still in development and misses some components

Other:

- [react-native-web-lite](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/packages/react-native-web-lite)
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@originjs/webpack-to-vite
