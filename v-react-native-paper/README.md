## Notes

Warnings:

```
"textAlignVertical" style is deprecated. Use "verticalAlign". index.js:24:12
props.pointerEvents is deprecated. Use style.pointerEvents index.js:24:12
accessibilityRole is deprecated. Use role. index.js:24:12
"transform" style array value is deprecated. Use space-separated string functions, e.g., "scaleX(2) rotateX(15deg)". index.js:24:12
selectable prop is deprecated. Use styles.userSelect. index.js:24:12
focusable is deprecated. index.js:24:12
Animated: `useNativeDriver` is not supported because the native animated module is missing. Falling back to JS-based animation. To resolve this, add `RCTAnimation` module to this app, or remove `useNativeDriver`. Make sure to run `bundle exec pod install` first.
